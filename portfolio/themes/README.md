## Setup PaperMod

Inside this directory execute the following command to clone the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme locally:

    git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git

For some reason if the name of the project has been changed from `hugo-PaperMod` to something else please rename the default theme in the config.toml file. Use the changed name while executing the `hugo -t hugo-PaperMod` further during the setup.
